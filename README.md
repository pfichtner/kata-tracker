# kata-tracker

Track state and trend of your kata/dojo workflow. 

Heavily inspired by/based on ideas of [Llewellyn Falco](https://github.com/isidore) (the tracker: https://github.com/LearnWithLlew/ExtremeFakeItTillYouMakeIt.Java) 
and [Nitsan Avni](https://github.com/nitsanavni) (the chart/graph https://github.com/nitsanavni/katas/tree/main/shortest-longest-red). 

...more to come
